moving forward ideas

- Make a change to the project, then republish with Lerna. Might have issues using the CLI to run npx again
- Change file outputs to be non JSON files and a little more user friendly to read ( .js would be pretty good )
- code editor height could move with the code being added to it
- some default notes would be good to have in the code editor
- some kind of header bar to make things look a little better
- different theme options. or at least a custom theme
